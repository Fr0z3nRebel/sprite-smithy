Follow DRY. Prefer small, composable functions. Reuse existing utilities/components where possible; extract shared helpers instead of copy‑pasting.

When told to commit: use a semantic subject 50 characters or less; wrap body at 72 characters; body has three sentences: what changed, why, how it was tested, separated by blank lines.

Touch only files needed for the current request. When proposing changes, show only relevant diffs or patched snippets, not full files, unless asked.

Use quick reasoning for small edits; reserve deep step‑by‑step reasoning for complex tasks. If the task is ambiguous, ask 1–3 short clarification questions instead of changing many files.
