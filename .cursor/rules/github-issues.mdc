# GitHub Issue Creation Guidelines

When creating GitHub issues (via `gh issue create`), write them as a professional senior software engineer or product development manager would. Use the GitHub CLI to create issues.

## Issue Structure

Every issue must include:

### 1. Title

- Clear, concise, and actionable (e.g., "Add export to PDF" not "Export feature")
- Use imperative mood
- Keep under 80 characters

### 2. User Story

Use the standard format:

```
As a [role/persona], I want to [action/capability], so that [benefit/outcome].
```

- **Role**: Who is the user? (e.g., "blog author", "content creator", "developer")
- **Action**: What do they want to do?
- **Benefit**: Why does it matter? What problem does it solve?

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

Provide a clear, testable checklist. Use markdown:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1: Specific, verifiable condition
- [ ] Criterion 2: Another measurable outcome
- [ ] Criterion 3: Edge cases or error handling
```

- Each criterion must be independently verifiable
- Use "Given X, when Y, then Z" when helpful
- Include both happy path and edge cases

### 4. Additional Sections (as needed)

- **Context/Background**: Why is this needed? Link to discussions or prior work.
- **Technical Notes**: Constraints, dependencies, or implementation hints.
- **Out of Scope**: What this issue explicitly does *not* cover.

## gh CLI Usage

Create issues with:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Title here" --body "Body content here"
```

For multi-line bodies, use a here-doc or temp file:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Add export to PDF" --body-file -
# Paste or pipe content, then Ctrl+D
```

Or write the body to a file first, then:

```bash
gh issue create --title "..." --body-file issue-body.md
```

## Example

**Title:** Add dark mode toggle to settings

**Body:**

```markdown
## User Story

As a blog author who works late, I want to switch the app to dark mode, so that I can reduce eye strain and work comfortably in low-light environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Toggle appears in the settings page and is clearly labeled
- [ ] Preference persists across page reloads and browser sessions
- [ ] All main UI surfaces (editor, sidebar, modals) respect the theme
- [ ] Toggle state matches system preference when "Auto" is selected (if applicable)

## Technical Notes

- Use CSS variables or Tailwind dark mode for theming
- Store preference in localStorage with key `theme`
```

## Labels

Apply labels when relevant (e.g., `enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`, `good first issue`):

```bash
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "enhancement"
```
